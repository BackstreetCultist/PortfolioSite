<h2>{_frontmatter.description}</h2>

For my first portfolio entry, I thought I'd take a look at exactly how I built
and deployed the site you are currently reading. Or, rather, how I build and
deploy the website, since I frequently update it when I have the idea for a
new feature or simply want a break from my more typical work as a student and
back-end developer.

As that implies, I don't have a background in web development. As such, I began
by searching for a web framework that was modern, fast, and easy to get to
grips with. [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) seemed an obvious choice,
especially since I anticipated the website containing primarily static content
such as a blog and portfolio. The primary purpose of the website was to give me
a space to archive and explain some of the many projects I've been a part of,
as well as to share my thoughts on computing and technology. As such,
simplicity seemed to be the order of the day.

Constructing the website on my local machine indeed proved relatively simple.
Gatsby proved a joy to work with, well documented and tutorialised, and easy
even for an inexperienced JavaScript developer like myself.
