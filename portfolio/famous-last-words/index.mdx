<h2>{_frontmatter.description}</h2>

The third hackathon for me and my friends in the Dream Team* was CovHack 2020,
held in February of that year at the University of Coventry. Following the
success of [Look Alive, Sunshine](https://charliewilkins.tech/portfolio/look-alive-sunshine),
we hoped to create a similar darkly whimsical, not-to-be-taken-seriously
project in which a Command & Control cloud server managed a sprawling network
of components and micro-services. This architecture had proved a winning formula
as it meant there was always a variety of tasks to complete and team members
were never "sitting on their hands". This isn't to say that we were resting on
our laurels, and we decided (based on me and one other team member being [AI specialists]() [TODO LINK])
that an AI component should this time be included, to increase the complexity
of the project. We ended up including two.

The impetus for this project was, as it so often is, an argument. Or rather
arguments - we were concerned that the amount of, shall we say, 'robust'
political debates occuring in our local Discord server was creeping up and up.
Wouldn't it be great if a Discord bot could be relied upon to nix such discussions?
Wouldn't it be even better if it could use AI to do it? And, more to the point,
wouldn't it be better still if the very *need* for political debate was removed,
the bot instead able to dictate a political message to those under its purview?
Thus was born Famous Last Words, a Discord auto-moderator perfect for a
totalitarian government.

As I have discussed, Famous Last Words used a variety of services and features
to bring across its 'message'. At its heart was a Discord bot that was attached
to a channel in a Discord server. It relayed every message it saw to the Command
& Control server, once again provided by Google Cloud. Another exciting feature
of the GC platform is Sentiment Analysis, an AI able to determine the beliefs
expressed in a string of text. This rather eerie tool would be perfect for
evaluating users' political beliefs - we simply had to tell it what we were
listening for. We decided that, for the purposes of demonstrating the project,
Famous Last Words should be being operated by a totalitarian *vegan* society,
and thus that the bot would be triggered by expressing a positive opinion
about meat or meat-eating.

Once triggered, Famous Last Words took two actions. The first occured within the
Discord server, the other in the physical world. The Discord user who had alerted
the bot would find themselves moved into a seperate channel and bombarded with
propaganda posters. This was where the second AI component came in.

A GPT-3 text processor, fed by the transcription of a long tirade made by a
militant vegan at a rally and found online, would generate short slogans
disparaging the eating of meat and aiming to guide the user back towards the
correct path. These were overlayed onto *politburo*-esque posters featuring a
variety of team members and other hackathon attendees.

These posters were generated on the C&C server using a python script, before
being sent back down to the bot to dispatch the user. While the short length of
the source transcript (and the difficulty in finding anything else similarly
aggressive) meant the slogans were somewhat repetitive, it was still a very
effective tool. Paired with the hardware component of the project, it created a
rather unnerving effect.

Codenamed the "Eye of Sauron" (which is [somewhat eerily prescient]() [TODO LINK]),
Famous Last Words' hardware component was envisioned as a glowing warning light
which would threaten the user with the knowledge that their subversive messaging
had been detected. The initial pitch was, naturally, for one large glowing red
eye, but we were aware that we would be limited in what we could throw together
(for all the hardware they provide, Major League Hacking fell short in the
giant-glowing-eye department). Me and another team member were dispatched to a
nearby HobbyCraft** to see what we could turn up, and returned with a large
round wooden box (to contain the hardware) and an expressionless cardboard
mask, eyes shut, to become the Eye.

Using hot glue and small round trays, translucent eyepieces were made. When a 
red LED placed behind them was activated, it diffused through the glue to create
an ominous crimson glow. These were mounted behind the eyes, the eyelids cut open
and attached on motorised strings that could pull them up into the recesses of
the mask, revealing the eyes which would then light up. Controlled by my Raspberry
Pi 4, Sunshine, this created a genuinely nightmarish effect after some tweaking.

As with Look Alive, Sunshine, Famous Last Words was not exactly concieved with
real-world applications in mind. Having said that, my takeaway from this project
is to be a little more unnerved - Famous Last Words was almost *too* easy to
throw together. This is not to disparage the efforts of myself or my team - on
the contrary, I still believe this is a very impressive project given the 24-hour
time limit, but that's the thing - if we can throw this together in 24 hours for
a laugh, how much further could it be taken - *is* it being taken - by malicious
actors with the backing of entire nation-states?

As impressive as it is, and as fun as it was to work on, I believe Famous Last
Words perhaps works best as a reminder of the awesome power of the technology
this community builds, and our responsibility to use it appropriately. That
being said, I genuinely did greatly enjoy working on it and am extremely proud
of our team's accomplishments. It impressed the judges too - our server architecture
and deployment of Sentiment Analysis (which I've never seen deployed by other
hackathon projects) netted us a Best Use of Google Cloud prize.
