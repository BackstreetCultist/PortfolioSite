<h2>{_frontmatter.description}</h2>

<h3>
TLDR: Users are encouraged to excerise and explore their local area, receiving
cryptic prompts on their phone and having to take photographs based on the
prompt to progress. Users who fail face a 'forfeit' wherein random images from
their phone are texted to randomly selected contacts. An iPhone app created in
Swift, which is backed by a Google Cloud C&C server implemented in NodeJS.
<br />Created at HackNotts 2020, The World is Ugly recieved an overall second-place
from the judges.
</h3>

Our hackathon team, the Dream Team, had made our debut at HackNotts 2019 with
Bulletproof Future, a critical and near-total failure that we quickly agreed
never to bring up again*. Since then, however, we racked up the Best Hardware
Hack award at ManMetHacks 2.0 for [Look Alive, Sunshine](https://www.charliewilkins.tech/portfolio/look-alive-sunshine) and Best
Use of Google Cloud at CovHack 2020 for [Famous Last Words](https://www.charliewilkins.tech/portfolio/famous-last-words).
Returning to HackNotts for the (remotely-held) 2020 competition therefore, we
wanted to do something to right our previous wrongs. The result was The World
is Ugly, an impressive showcase of our collective skills which also has the
distinction of being the most "serious" project we've yet completed, although
there is still a touch of our trademark macabre humour.

The World is Ugly was concieved as an excerise app that would encourage users
to explore their local area, with integrated AR elements and a storyline that
the user explored, with an elevator pitch of "[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) meets [Zombies, Run!](https://zombiesrungame.com/)".
A subversise spy in a dystopic world, the user would recieve cryptic
commands from, well, Command, which would correspond to tasks the user would
need to complete in the real world. Multiple tasks were planned, but the only
one implemented was the taking of a photograph answering the "riddle" given
to the user. Once a photograph was taken using the iPhone app, it would be
uploaded to the system's Command & Control server, built using Google Cloud.
GC's Vision platform allows the analysis of images by AI, which was used to
determine whether or not the user had met their prompt.

The most dramatic part of the app, however, came up if the user's submission
was judged incorrect. A forfeit was needed, and our team never approached a
task like this by half. Given that this time we were operating from a phone
app, we could request access to a user's photos, and decided to use this to
our advantage. Firstly, a random image would be selected from the user's phone.
This would then be uploaded to the C&C server, and published to the Web.
Using Twilio (remember them?), a randomly-selected contact from the user's
phone would be texted a link to the photograph. It may have been innocuous, but
it may not have been. Naturally, this was the kind of feature that would have faced
the axe were The World is Ugly to become a real product, but it suited our
purposes of demonstrating our skills and amusing other hackathon attendees.

In fact, it did more than amuse them. Backed by [a rather entertaining video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcIB49siWGI)
(which arguably does a better job of explaining than I ever could), The World
is Ugly picked up the Second Overall commendation at HackNotts 2020. As I've said,
I have a real fondness for this project - it mixes various technologies to
create an engaging and immersive experience that demonstrates various talents
among the development team. Additionally, it's almost something that could one
day be released to the public (or at least an early test for such), which is
unusual for us. I had a great time building it as well!
