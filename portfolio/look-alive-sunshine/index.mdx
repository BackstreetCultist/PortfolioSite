<h2>{_frontmatter.description}</h2>

ManMetHacks 2.0, held January 2020, was a fantastic competition and made for a
terrific second outing for my hackathon team, loosely termed the Dream Team.
The only issue was, it took place in Manchester, a long and tiring coach ride
away for us. By the time hacking started at 12 noon, we were more in a mood to
go back to bed than to get building. We needed something to keep ourselves
working, and we figured future hackathon entrants might as well.

Thus began the building of Look Alive, Sunshine, a rather silly project intended
to push the boundaries of what can be termed a 'productivity tool'. Constructed
as an extension for the Visual Studio Code IDE, Look Alive, Sunshine keeps
developers working by a variety of means, each triggered by a 'threat level'
that is raised when a time increment passes and the developer does not type.
For example, if the time limit were set to 10 seconds, then 10 seconds without
typing would raise the threat level to 1, and a further 10 would raise it to 2.

Each threat level triggered a different action for the system, derived from the
technology made available by the hackathon's sponsors. The first threat level
merely alerted the user within their IDE, while the second and third caused
a text message and a phone call respectively to be sent to the user. This phone
interface was provided by phone API operator Twilio, who sponsored the
competition with free credit.

These initial threats were really fun to develop and see in action, particularly
the phone call which made use of distorted audio to create a genuinely creepy
effect. However, it was threat levels four and five which really made the
project what it was. Another sponsor of the project was Google Cloud, and while
we initially only intended to use this to create a Command & Control server to
delegate API calls, we quickly became interested in what else it could do.
It is helpful at this point to look at the overall structure of the Look Alive,
Sunshine project to see where exactly this technology was used.

Threat Level 4 needed to be something dramatic, as clearly directly contacting
the user has at that point failed to return them to work. It ocurred to us that,
if the user's computer was on but they were not typing, they were likely doing
something else with their machine, such as browsing the web. "Wouldn't it be
great", we thought, "if we were able to shame the user for their distraction?"
The phrase 'Post their internet history on Twitter' was soon flying around the
table, and receiving worried looks from other entrants passing by. This did
little to deter us.

Perhaps thankfully, a user's browser history is not very easy for Google Cloud
to access directly. Put another, more worrying way, it is very easy to access
by Google Cloud if the cloud platform is, vampirically, invited. The simplest
way is to access the history via a Chrome browser extension, so we quickly threw
together a minimal one that provided the correct access. This along with the
VS Code extension were thus the "deliverable" that a user would host on their
machine to actually *use* Look Alive, Sunshine. When polled by the C&C server
with the relevant Google Account details, the extension was able to return the
user's most recent Chrome history. It was a simple matter to pass that to a
Twitter bot, and Threat Level 4 had been created.

At this point, it ocurred to us that, perhaps, Look Alive, Sunshine was all
stick and no carrot. Threat Level 5, we thought, ought to be something that
helped rather than terrified a user. And, not content with the amount of work
we had already planned in for this 24-hour hack (which we were already two
hours in to and still planning!), we decided it ought to be a coffee machine.

I'd brought along my Raspberry Pi 4 to use as a server, but we'd ended up using
Google Cloud instead. It was still a powerful piece of equipment to have access
to, particularly for its hardware-control capabilities, and between that and a
small pool of components provided by Major League Hacking we decided we had
everything we needed for at least a proof-of-concept coffee-maker. The
construction of this machine was simple - two containers, one of water and one
of powdered coffee, which dispensed their contents into a third section which
mixed them by spinning. Unfortunately, this 'spinning' aspect did not come to
fruition, but the machine still proved its potential. When activated by the
C&C server at Threat Level 5, the coffee machine (named 'Sunshine') poured its
contents into a mixing bowl, demonstrating the planned if incomplete operation
of the device.

This hardware addition to the largely software-based project proved very useful
for us as, after some debate about how exactly to judge it, Look Alive, Sunshine
was awarded the Best Hardware Hack prize by the event's judges.

Naturally, I don't intend to present Look Alive, Sunshine as a genuine
productivity tool or management solution. Indeed, in a world where monitoring
tools are increasingly used by managers to measure developers working from home,
the project feels increasingly like a bizarre satire of corporate software development's worst excesses.
However it was primarily intended as, and still works best as, a proof of all
that can be done when a team of skilled developers throws caution to the wind
and applies all their skills to one simple goal.

I had an absolute blast working on it, and I learned a great deal about everything
from Node server architectures to hardware. If you're planning on going to any
hackathons soon (which I recommend!) I'll always say that the best approach is
the one presented here. Ironically, I did end up having a rather more serious
development role involving text-messaging systems, but that is a
[story for another time]() [TODO blog post about Nova Team].
