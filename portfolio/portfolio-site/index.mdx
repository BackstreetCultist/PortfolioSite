<h3>
TLDR: A static portfolio & blog, built in GatsbyJS using SASS Modules
for styling. The site is deployed using AWS Amplify, which is able to fully
integrate with GitHub for continuous deployment.
</h3>

For my first portfolio entry, I thought I'd take a look at exactly how I built
and deployed the site you are currently reading. Or, rather, how I build and
deploy the website, since I frequently update it when I have the idea for a
new feature or simply want a break from my more typical work as a student and
back-end developer.

As that implies, I don't have a background in web development. As such, I began
by searching for a web framework that was modern, fast, and easy to get to
grips with. [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) seemed an obvious choice,
especially since I anticipated the website containing primarily static content
such as a blog and portfolio. The primary purpose of the website was to give me
a space to archive and explain some of the many projects I've been a part of,
as well as to share my thoughts on computing and technology. As such,
simplicity seemed to be the order of the day.

Constructing the website on my local machine was indeed relatively simple.
Gatsby proved a joy to work with, well documented and tutorialised, and easy
even for an inexperienced JavaScript developer like myself.

The website was initially constructed in JavaScript using [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), and these SASS components were later
re-written as Modules (the SASS equivalent to CSS Modules). A future goal of
the project is to re-write the entire site into TypeScript - a glance around
the rest of my portfolio will no doubt reveal my love of strictly-typed
languages!

With the blog developed locally, I then sought a way to deploy it to my domain.
As an experienced and [certified AWS developer](https://www.charliewilkins.tech/blog/nova-team), I
considered the various options AWS provides in order to create a scalable,
pay-as-you-go website in as simple a manner as possible.

I eventually chose AWS Amplify, as it included in-built support for Gatsby
deployment as well as automatic continuous deployment with GitHub. As such, there are four
steps to the deployment of the site:

1. Website is modified locally. I do my best work on a cannibalised HP laptop running Debian Linux.
2. Local changes are pushed to remote repository stored on GitHub.
3. AWS Amplify is notified by GitHub and redeploys site.
4. Website deployed by AWS and is served to your computer.

Building this portfolio website has been and continues to be an extremely
rewarding experience. It's by far the largest amount of modern JavaScript I've
written, and while I still prefer back-end development I've very much enjoyed
getting to grips with Gatsby, SASS and React. I'm always excited to re-open
this repository and add a new feature when an idea strikes me.
