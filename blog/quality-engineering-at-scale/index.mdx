Second blog post! I think I'm going to try and use my own photographs in these,
something representative (and free) rather than specific (and copyrighted). I'm
not a particularly good photographer, but I'm an enthusiastic amateur - this one
was taken near the Cassley Falls in Sutherland, Scotland, on a two-week holiday
I took during the six months I spent as a Quality Engineer at Capital One UK. And
that's how you write a segue.

I really enjoyed my first six months at Capital One, as a good old-fashioned
backend software engineer*, but when it came time to transition to my second of
the two planned six-month placements, I wanted a change. It wasn't that I wanted
a change of language, but a change of role - I'd worked closely with the QEs in
Nova Team, and become fascinated not just with the process of writing tests but
of planning them, deciding exactly what needed testing and when, building the
frameworks to execute them, and afterwards working out exactly what the results
meant. Additionally, I'd recently completed my AWS Cloud Practitioner
certification, and I was fascinated by how Capital One's vast cloud systems
were architected. Quality Engineering therefore seemed the natural next step
for me.

I turned out to be in luck - there was an opening for a QE in a Java backend
team similar to the one I was leaving, albeit tackling a very different area of
the business. Purple Pandas were a relatively new outfit, formed around the
time I'd joined the company as part of an effort to replace existing on-premise
legacy systems with a network of new AWS microservices. This was a
mission-critical system, a failure of which would be significantly damaging to
the business. Quality control was naturally crucial.

The effort was large enough to require four development teams, two for frontend
and two for backend. In this "super-team" structure, QEs took on the role of
go-betweens and almost formed a team in their own right, complete with weekly
stand-ups where tasks would be handed out. This was supported by team managers,
who accepted that QEs would require time for out-of-team work, and would rely
on us to inform the rest of the team of decisions within the space of the wider
project. I saw first-hand just how crucial this arrangement was to the success
of the ongoing project, as this semi-formal inter-team network was highly
effective at organising their own work, petitioning their teams to complete
work other teams were relying on, and maintaining a wider view of the project,
all the while also doing the day-to-day QE work of testing and pipeline
maintenance. This is large-scale quality engineering done right: understanding
that both the quality of individual pieces and the quality of the system as a
whole are important, and making the correct decisions to improve both.

All of this is a rather lofty way of saying that we carried out a *lot* of
contract testing. The new system was being built in stages, meaning that each
new service had to be both compatible with those around it *and* fully
backwards-compatible with the legacy systems. API contracts became sacred
documents and sources-of-truth - living documents, as the needs of the service
changed, but only ever modified with cross-party consent. The involved teams
placed a huge deal of trust in one another, and QEs and our tests were there to
facilitate that trust.

In another blog post, perhaps I'll talk more about the individual tests we
wrote and how we approached them, but I'm not sure that was my most important
take-away from my time in Purple Pandas. The project was still moving forwards
when I left Capital One, far from complete, but in the six months I was there I
saw the progress we made. I also saw how we made it - trust, I think, is the key
word. Trust at every level - trust between developers and QEs within teams that
each will carry out their duties, trust between teams facilitated by QEs that
each team will complete their work, and trust between engineers and management
that both sides will be permitted to make the correct decisions for the project.
Quality engineering is the art of building trustworthy systems, and trustworthy
systems are only built *by* trustworthy systems.

\* There'll be a proper write-up at some point
