I've always been a fan of detective thrillers, and as such, I know you have to
start at the beginning. So welcome to my website! My name is Charlie Wilkins,
and I am (at time of writing) a recent graduate in Computer Science with Artificial
Intelligence at the University of Nottingham, UK. As part of my studies, I
completed a year's internship as a software and quality engineer at Capital One
UK, and am currently open to offers of employment as I begin my career in
earnest.

It's hard to say exactly when my love for computer engineering took hold. I
think Minecraft had something to do with it (in fact, I think this is true for
most programmers of about my age), and for a long time in my teens I wanted to
be a game developer. However, throughout my A-Levels and degree study I realised
that, although I'll always love *playing* games, I didn't necessarily want to
build them. Instead, my tastes in computer engineering drifted to where they are
now, and what I love building now - primarily artificial intelligence, backend
software, and embedded systems. However exactly it happened then, I started in
my teens and never looked back.

The idea for this blog came when I was working at Capital One, and had the good
fortune to be on a team with Jamie Tanna, whose own blog is something to be
envied. I wanted a place to summarise both my thoughts about the field and the
projects I've worked on (largely those created in my free time for rights
reasons, naturally), and so I got to work. The end result is the site you're
looking at right now - for more information on how it got to you, check out my
[portfolio entry](https://www.charliewilkins.tech/portfolio/portfolio-site).

Besides serving as a space for my ramblings, this website hosts my CV and contact
details, which can be found [on the About Me page](https://www.charliewilkins.tech/about). While this is the
blog post I'm completing first, I have plans for several more, and will keep
updating whenever I get the chance. Expect a mixture of tutorials, musings,
reflections and the occasional game recommendation. So stick around! I think
it's going to be fun.
