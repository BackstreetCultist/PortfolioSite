Elsewhere on this website, as I'm sure you'll have noticed if you've looked
around, I've said that I'm a recent computer science graduate. Specifically, I
graduated the University of Nottingham with a BSc degree in "Computer Science
with Artificial Intelligence with Year in Industry", which is downright
difficult to fit in one line on most CV templates. I've [already started]()
[TODO LINK] a series of blogs about the Year in Industry part, which I've come
away feeling extremely positive about, but I thought I would make a change from
the regularly scheduled programming and talk about the other bit for a moment.
Here, my feelings are more mixed. Not negative, but mixed.

Looking back, I'm honestly not sure I knew all that much about Artificial
Intelligence when I was applying to universities, but given I came a hair's
breadth from doing an acting degree instead\*, it's best not to think of me as
an expert at that point. It was just a lot of very very exciting terminology
to me - Neural nets! Machine learning! Evolutionary computing! I think that I
had a nebulous idea of AI as *the thing* that I wanted a piece of, and so
AI-specific courses naturally caught my eye.

I can't remember exactly how many of the universities I applied to made some
mention of AI in the degree title - but I think at least my top two picks,
Southampton and Nottingham, were 'with AI' courses. I ended up picking
Nottingham with a decent degree of certainty, perhaps I'll talk about how at
some point, and there I was, off to get my shiny AI-specialist degree.

The thing about AI degrees is, of course, that they don't change all that much.
Bear in mind, I'm speaking entirely from my own personal experience here, and
I've only got the one, but AI degrees don't offer any particularly special
teaching. All of the AI modules I took as part of my degree, I could have taken
anyway. The specialism is very much a 'soft' one - a tutor who was an AI
specialist, recommendations for some modules, support coming up with an
AI-related dissertation topic - and in exchange, the course actually
artificially *limits* the student's choice of modules by forcing them to take
certain AI ones. Looking back, I think for some students this isn't really a
fair trade.

It's here that this post becomes frustratingly vague and watered-down, at least
to my ears. I *did* enjoy my AI degree, and I'm glad I took it. I do genuinely
believe that that 'with AI' would probably earn my CV a closer look from a
recruiter were I to apply for a data science or machine learning position, and
if I got it I would definitely feel prepared. That doesn't change the fact,
though, that there were times it did feel a little restrictive, and I think for
many students it must have felt much more so.

Thankfully, there is a bit of an easy solution, at least when it comes to the
University of Nottingham. Their policy, and I assume the policy of many others,
is to allow very easy switching between the various computer science courses.
As such, while I can honestly say I'm glad I took the course I did, I'm not
sure I'd recommend *applying* for it. It's probably preferable, at least in my
mind, to apply and join a regular CS course, and only consider transferring
once you have some proper experience with working on AI. If you've been
building machine learning models in your bedroom for years, of course, feel
free to disregard this, but if there's any part of your brain that says 'I'm
not sure' I'd recommend listening to it. If the uni you're thinking of seems
amenable to course changes, you could be saving yourself a lot of hassle.

Of course, if the course you're looking at genuinely does offer access to some
modules or experiences you wouldn't otherwise have available to you, then the
question becomes very different - but I'm not sure how many like this there are
out there. If you've done one, feel free to get in touch! I'll add a little
amendment to this article (or maybe it'll finally prompt me to build a
comment section).

my goddess, to thy law my services are bound..."
