I've already blogged about my [second six months at Capital One](https://www.charliewilkins.tech/blog/quality-engineering-at-scale),
and my time as a quality engineer. This time, I've decided to take a step back
and give an overview of the first of my two half-year stints, which I spent as
a regular backend software development engineer.

I was in touch with Nova Team a couple of times in the two or three weeks
leading up to the official start of my placement, which I thought was a really
good choice by my manager to help me feel included. I spoke to him and to my
assigned mentor, and at one point I got to join a team stand-up. I won't
pretend to have had any idea what was going on in it by then, but that wasn't
the point - getting to meet all of my colleagues, albeit briefly, really made
me feel like a part of the team. And even if I didn't understand everything
that was said, I at least gathered that we had a lot of work to do.

Nova Team were a communications-focussed team, building and maintaining the
gateways used by email and SMS messages sent to customers. The majority of
these had been built on-premise, and as part of Capital One's ongoing AWS
migration, were being re-architected into the cloud one by one. This was a very
exciting prospect for me, as I'd only toyed with cloud for a [couple of](https://www.charliewilkins.tech/portfolio/look-alive-sunshine)
[hackathon projects](https://www.charliewilkins.tech/portfolio/famous-last-words)
and never created a larger project. Getting
to be a part of this migration then seemed like a really cutting-edge and
meaningful project to be a part of. It was also, of course, an incredibly large
and complex project, far bigger than anything I'd previously encountered.

Thankfully, it turns out that Capital One's onboarding and starter process for
new developers is... honestly, pretty great. It's clearly a well-oiled machine,
which given the huge numbers of graduates and long-term interns they take on
isn't exactly surprising, but is still very impressive. In particular, I found
it extremely easy to locate and access training materials, both in the sense of
being properly signposted to the ones I needed, and in the sense that they were
paid for by the company. Alongside this, we were allocated 10% Time (which Nova
tended to take on a Friday afternoon, natch!) in which to improve our skills or
work on (relevant) passion projects. I dedicated this time to improving my
cloud knowledge, and within six months I had achieved AWS Certified Cloud
Practitioner status, passing the exam not long after requesting the time and
funds to sit it.

All of this is of course to say nothing of my team, who were in fact a far
bigger part of my on-the-job learning than formal training materials. Capital
One's robust mentor/buddy system meant that I had two points of contact
whenever I had questions, and frequent opportunites for pair-programming. I
really don't think you can overstate the usefulness and importance of training
new developers, as it means that they are instantly able to get wokring on code
while still being kept within team style and coding norms. It is also useful
for the more experienced in the pair, who may benefit from a new viewpoint and
person to discuss with, particularly in the case of difficult problems. As it
happened, I was able to experience this from both sides, as towards the end of
my tenure in Nova Team (by which time my mentor had unfortunately left) I took
on an unofficial mentoring role for a new team member, and together we were
able to make several crucial changes and improvements to the codebase we were
working on.

To conclude, then, I won't pretend that I wasn't a little intimidated upon
arriving at Capital One. However, their robust onboarding process and mentoring
scheme meant that I was up to speed very quickly, even to the point of being
able to mentor others in a limited capacity. Along the way, I picked up many
cloud skills, and even an official qualification.
